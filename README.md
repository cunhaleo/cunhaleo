## Welcome! 🤓

- 🫡 My name is Leonardo Cunha.
- 💻 I'm a passionate iOS Software Developer and an Automation Engineer.<br/>
- ❇️ I strive to keep my things as clean as i can, that includes this README file.<br/>
- 📌 I'll pin some of my recent projects in here.
- 👨🏻‍💻 These projects are mostly focused on learning:
  - Frameworks
  - Architectural concepts
  - Design patterns
  - Testing
- 💅 So you may find some goofy UI, and thats OK. My goal is to make their **code** look good.
